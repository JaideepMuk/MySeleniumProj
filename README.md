Project has 2 tests to run the cases in Chrome / Firefox
Each Test will use 3 search engines (Google / Bing / Yahoo) 
Multiple Validations will be performed on the screen based on test data (ie search criterias present in excel sheet)
Results are logged for each steps & exceptions will provide details (in case of any errors)
Test Data is also used to build the objects dynamically 
Config file is used to control the synchronizations (implicit/explicit)
Both the test can run parallely (headless mode) using command line / testng.xml
